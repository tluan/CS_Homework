Reflection:This program I wrote was to use to find the information for a specific place input. This homework is easier than the last one, because I basically just changed some codes from the last assignment and replaced the data file to finish the goal. What I need to write was less than the last one.At first I jumped into several syntax errors, for example, I did not consider the case that the user did not input strings with comma. So when user inputted strings without comma, my split method would jump into errors and could not compile. Also, I felt confused about the counting. I was not sure that if I should calculate the times of comparisons between places (meaning a comparisons between states and towns are counted as one place comparison) or if I should calculate the times of comparisons between towns and states. So finally I did both of the total states and towns counts and the places counts.
